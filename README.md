# 🩺 Early Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease in individuals based on their medical data using machine learning classification techniques. Early prediction can support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a heart disease dataset that includes the following features:

- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `ChestPainType`
- `RestingBP`
- `Cholesterol`
- `FastingBS`
- `RestingECG`
- `MaxHR`
- `ExerciseAngina`
- `Oldpeak`
- `ST_Slope`
- `HeartDisease` (Target)

💡 *Optional:* Another dataset was used for comparison or improvement purposes.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML Models & Evaluation)
- Google Colab
- Gradio (for simple UI deployment)

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models Applied
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

✅ Models are compared using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
